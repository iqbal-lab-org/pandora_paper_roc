1. The reality of bacterial genetics
   - Horizontal transfer adds as much variation as vertical SNP/indel inheritance
   - The result is that for species like E. coli, 2 samples share 60% of genes
   - In addition, many bacterial species have a huge pangenome repertoire of genes which have been found
   - The result of this is that, except for a clonal outbreak, samples are often divergent from each other
2. The problem with ignoring this reality (current methods)
   - The paradigm where we use a single best reference and describe variation between samples by comparing differences only works in the shared part of the genome
   - This means that we can only do variant calling for a diverse set of genomes at the moment in the core, and only with short reads 
   - This paradigm is even less likely to extend to long reads, due to the structural variation we expect - reads may not map at all
   - This paradigm separates "how related are my samples on a tree", from "for a given gene of interest, what variation do I see accross the samples"
3. Locally, we can compare bacterial genomes
   - there are (must be) examples of tools where they have compared individual AMR gene variants between samples (is done by typing)
4. We present...
   - a unified framework for local and global variation analysis in such species
   - this framework uses a novel pangenome reference graph structure
   - we demonstrate on 2 datasets that we can do blah (even with nanopore)
