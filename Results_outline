Results:
1. Novel Pangenome Reference Graph structure
   - Figure: Cartoon showing how we break up pangenome into bits, and with reads infer presence/absence. 
             For nanopore also order, but not illumina.
   - for details see methods
2. Pandora:
   - Figure: Workflow including indexing, quasi-mapping, sequence inference, genotyping, de novo 
   - for details see methods
3. Sensitivity/specificity and proportion of genome accessed results
   - For 1 cardio, run pandora, snippy and nanopolish (270 RefSeq references, subset 10 showing range)
   - Figure: a) y-axis proportion of compatible vcf sites genotyped, x-axis proportion of genotyped sites FP, 
                point for each confidence threshold
             b) y-axis fraction of truth assembly aligned against by updated reference for a single given gt_confidence,
                x-axis number of SNPs/gSNPS/indel/gindels (or a point for each) in mummer report in aligned region
   - For remaining 4 cardio, evaluate pandora performance, generate plots/a table summerizing for supplemental results
4. Comparing samples and adding value
   - For 15 cardio, run pandora compare
   - Figure: 2 facing trees, 1 based on SNPs in core genes, the other showing tree from old methods
   - Figure: 2 facing trees, 1 based on (the same) SNPs in core genes, the other based on accessory genes
   - NB this could be done instead for the prospective cardio dataset or kleb dataset if we get results in time
