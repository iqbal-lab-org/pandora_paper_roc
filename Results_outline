Results:
1. Novel Pangenome Reference Graph structure
   - Figure: Cartoon showing how we break up pangenome into bits, and with reads infer presence/absence. 
             For nanopore also order, but not illumina.
   - for details see methods
2. Pandora:
   - Figure: Workflow including indexing, quasi-mapping, sequence inference, genotyping, de novo 
   - for details see methods
3. Precision/Recall 
   - For 2 cardio, run pandora, snippy and nanopolish (270 RefSeq references, subset 10 showing range) and output single sample VCFs
   - Estimate TP/FP (by GT_CONF) for each vcf using minos
   - For same pair of cardio, run dnadiff to get a panel of SNPs
   - Estimate the fraction of these sites which are covered by the VCFs. 
     To do this, take each row in dnadiff snps, and add flanks to alleles (A). 
     Similarly create sample allele+flank lists for each sample VCF (B).
     For each row in (A) search for the two strings as substrings of things in two (B) lists and in the vcfref file.
     If there we have 2 B hits, or 1 B hit and a vcfref hit, call it a TP', otherwise FN (GT_CONF is the max of the two sample GT_CONFs).
   - Figure: a) y-axis Recall TP'/(TP'+FN)
                Fraction of (a panel of) differences between the two samples which would be captured by a method
             b) x-axis 1-Precision FP/(TP+FP)
                Fraction of sites genotyped incorrectly (sum over both sample VCFs)
4. Comparing samples and adding value
   - For 15 cardio, run pandora compare
   - Figure: 2 facing trees, 1 based on (the same) SNPs in core genes, the other taking clusters (defined by core genes) 
      and drawing a tree based on accessory genes
   - NB this could be done instead for the prospective cardio dataset or kleb dataset if we get results in time
