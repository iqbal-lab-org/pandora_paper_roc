Bacterial pan-genome analysis with population graphs

Intro

1. The biology - what do we expect bacterial genomes to look like?
   - In bacteria, variation occurs in 3 ways: mutation, homologous recombination non-homologous recombination
   - For some species (e.g. E coli) the mutations occur as often as  homolgous recombinations
   - Mutations result in a closely related sequence
   - Homolgous recombinations give rise to gene sequences which are mosaics of previously seen gene sequences
   - Non-homologous recombination results in a genome with a large degree of structural and content variability
2. This underlying biology and the availability of sequenced genomes context ideal for pangenome graphs which explicitly infer new sequences as a mosaic of a panel of reference sequences
3. What do we want to use genome sequence data for?
   - AMR prediction - both presence and version of gene important
   - Outbreak tracking
4. What to current methods allow us to infer from sequence data and what do are their limitations?
   - Gene presence/absence (AMR prediction) e.g. 
     For Illumina data, downstream analysis can then allow variation detection in specific genes of interest
   - Variation detection in the core genome from Illumina (outbreak tracking)
   - None provide a framework to combine these and to describe variation in both the core and accessory genome
   - None allow variation detection from nanopore
5. What do we do?
   - We introduce a novel graph structure and inference method which allows simul-
   taneous  identification  of  pangenome  elements  which  are  present  and  genotyping
   within them
   - We handle long read sequence data, and  is  backward  compatible  with  illumina.  
   - We  are  able  to make  accurate  calls  from  nanopore  data  (TB)  
   - We  add  resolution  in  the  context  of  an  E.  coli  outbreak  by  considering  the  whole
   pangenome.

Results

1. Algorithms
   - Novel pan genome reference structure
   - Indexing PRGs with minimizing kmers
   - Inferring sequences as a mosaic through graph
   - Describing variation by comparison with an optimal reference
   - Novel variation detection
2. Datasets
   - Ecoli K12 - proof of principle, sample in graph, equivalent to simulations
     - Prove sequences do lie in graph
     - Given that sequences lie in graph, is like running simulations
     - Note don't need novel caller for this section
     - Proportion of genes correctly identified as present, number of false positives by coverage
     - For SNP sites in true positive gene vcfs, what proportion genotyped correctly by coverage
     - For indel sites in true positive gene vcfs, what proportion genotyped correctly by coverage
     - For all sites in true positive gene vcfs, what proportion genotyped correctly by coverage
     - For inferred gene sequences, how many bases away from reference genome is it?
     - Overall inferred gene sequence accuracy
     - Method:
       1. Take reference GFA and for each annotated gene, query if it is in the pangenome graphs
       2. For each coverage, run pandora
       3. Plot number of 
   - TB - accuracy from nanopore/novel detection
   - Cardio - comparison with other tools
     - To describe outbreak, want a multisample vcf showing how samples differ and a tree
     - Nanopore comparison method: Starting with the same read fasta, assemble with canu, polish with nanopolish and use minimap2/bwa to output a vcf with respect to (a) an ecoli reference, (b) the pacbio sequenced outbreak reference. Combine these accross samples and build a tree from them
     - For pandora, force vcf output to have reference from (a), (b) and try with best reference
     - Illumina comparison method: Cortex the samples to get a multivcf and turn into a tree

Thoughts about comparitors

1. PanSeq takes genomes or draft genomes and identifies regions which are core or accessory to them. Within the core it finds SNPs, and for all samples outputs presence/absence of all regions
   +ve identifies regions accross pangenome
   -ve only identifies SNPs
   -ve only variant calls in core
   -ve takes draft genomes (but this means could handle nanopore?)
2. Harvest (ParSNP) does core genome alignment and finds all variants in this core genome, with visuals from gingr
   +ve identifies regions accross pangenome
   +ve identifies SNPs indels and structural variants
   -ve only variation in core
   -ve takes draft genomes
   -ve requires genomes to be very closely related e.g. >97% id
3. Cortex allows variant calls between different samples (e.g. outbryk) everywhere
   +ve no assembly
   +ve all read data
   -ve complexity
   -ve no nanopore error handling
4. JR assembled read data (spades, hybridspades, canu) then mapped using their pipeline? The MSA output of this passed to IQTree and ClonalFrameML for phylogenies.
5. ARIBA?
6. GROOT - variation aware reference graphs for resistome typing
   -ve doesn't look like it does anything other than type
