class MAPQSamRecordsFilter(Filter):
    """
    Filters records based on MapQ, which tells us how confident we can be that the read comes from the reported position.

    If there are multiple alignments, keeps only the one with best MAPQ, based on the following constraints:
        -If the difference between the best and the second best MAPQ is too small (i.e. < 10), then discard all alignments to that probe (i.e. probe is ignored in the evaluation)
            -The reason is that we just have ambiguous data to say where it really came from, so the best is to avoid the evaluation of this probe
        -Otherwise, keeps only the one with best MAPQ

    Reasoning from https://www.biostars.org/p/179457/#299885:
    Alignment score is a metric that tells you how similar the read is to the reference. AS increases with the number of
    matches and decreases with the number of mismatches and gaps (rewards and penalties for matches and mismatches depend
    on the scoring matrix you use). MAPQ is a metric that tells you how confident you can be that the read comes from the
    reported position.
    You can have high AS and low MAPQ if the read aligns perfectly at multiple positions, and you can have low AS and
    high MAPQ if the read aligns with mismatches but still the reported position is still much more probable than any other.
