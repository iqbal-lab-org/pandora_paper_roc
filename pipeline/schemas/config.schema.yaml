        description:            Path to the output folder
    samples:
        type:                   string
        description:            Path to CSV file containing the samples information.
    variant_calls:
        type:                   string
        description:            Path to CSV file containing the variant calls information.
    variant_calls_flank_length_for_precision:
        type:                   number
        description:            The flank length to use for variant calls in precision assessment. This has to be a large flank (i.e. between 100 and 200).
    variant_calls_flank_length_for_recall:
        type:                   number
        description:            The flank length to use for variant calls in recall assessment. This has to be a small flank (i.e. between 20 and 50).
    truth_probes_flank_length_for_recall:
        type:                   number
        description:            The flank length to use for truth calls in recall assessment. This has to be a bit smaller than variant_calls_flank_length_for_recall.
    number_of_points_in_ROC_curve:
        type:                   number
        description:            Number of points to plot in the ROC curve. The higher, the better, but it is also slower.

    coverage_filters:
        type:                   array
        description:            VCF records having mean coverage smaller than this value will be filtered out from the analysis. One plot is produced for each value.

    strand_bias_filters:
        type:                   array
        description:            VCF records having a strand coverage ratio smaller than this value will be filtered out from the analysis. One plot is produced for each value.

    gaps_filters:
        type:                   array
        description:            VCF records having a gaps fractions larger than this value will be filtered out from the analysis. One plot is produced for each value.
