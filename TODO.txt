1. recall per sample
2. switch to https://github.com/mbhall88/pandora_simulations/blob/master/scripts/apply_vcf.py
3. remove plasmids

what proportion of SNPs are in the core, and not core?

what proportion of regions are core, not core and unique?
	-do the same plots without unique regions between two samples



bug applying vcf

what proportion of variable sites are we spotting (frequency 1, 2, 3 4)?


no deduplication - just give weights to the probe
	-maybe use pangenome snps (variable sites)
	-use pairwise differences (no deduplication at all)
	-weighted probes

check if the two alleles of a site is detected
