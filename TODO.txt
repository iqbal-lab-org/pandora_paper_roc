Done:
    -recall per sample
    -vcf apply bug fixed
    -plasmids removed from analysis
    -VCF calls genotyping towards REF are disregarded

what proportion of SNPs are in the core, and not core?

what proportion of regions are core, not core and unique?
	-do the same plots without unique regions between two samples

what proportion of variable sites are we spotting (frequency 1, 2, 3 4)?

no deduplication - just give weights to the probe
	-maybe use pangenome snps (variable sites)
	-use pairwise differences (no deduplication at all)
	-weighted probes

check if the two alleles of a site is detected
