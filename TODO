-improving 4-way:
    - instead of counting alleles in recall, we could count variants;
        - to find a variant, we need to make sure we find both alleles of the variants;
    - we could map truth probes to the genotyped ref to have another recall measurement - thus we would not penalize if no calls are made if ref == samples
        - but precision will hurt a lot, since now we are making many more calls tjem (one for each position in the genotyped ref)?
